## Lesson Curriculum

The SYCL Academy curriculum is divided up into a number of short lessons
consisting of slides for presenting the material and a more detailed write-up,
each accompanied by a tutorial for getting hands on experience with the subject
matter.

Each of the lessons are designed to be self contained modules in order to
support both academic and training style teaching environments.

### How to use the Materials

To use these materials simply clone this repository.

The lectures are written in reveal.js, and can be found in "Lesson_Materials",
in the sub-directory for each topic. To view them simply open the "index.html"
file in your browser. Your browser will have a "Full Screen" mode that can be
used to run the presentation, use the right and left cursors to move forward and
backward in the presentation.

The exercises can be found in "Code_Exercises" in the sub-directory for each
topic. Each exercise has a markdown document instructing what to do in the
exercise, a source file to start with and a solution file to provide an
example implementation to compare against.

## Building the Exercises

The exercises can be built for ComputeCpp CE, DPC++ and hipSYCL.

### Supported Platforms

Below is the supported platforms and devices for each SYCL implementations, see
this before deciding which SYCL implementation to use.

Make sure to also install the specified version to ensure that you can build
all of the exercises.

| Implementation | Supported Platforms | Supported Devices | Required Version |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| ComputeCpp | Windows 10 Visual Studio 2019 (64bit) <br> Ubtuntu 18.04 (64bit) | Intel CPU (OpenCL) <br> Intel GPU (OpenCL) | CE 2.0.0 |
| DPC++ | Intel DevCloud <br> Windows 10 Visual Studio 2019 (64bit) <br> Ubtuntu 18.04 (64bit) | Intel CPU (OpenCL) <br> Intel GPU (OpenCL) <br> Intel FPGA (OpenCL) <br> Nvidia GPU (CUDA) | 2021.1-beta05	|
| hipSYCL | Any Linux | CPU (OpenMP) <br> AMD GPU (ROCm)* <br> Nvidia GPU (CUDA) | Latest build |

\* Only the Vega 10 and Vega 20 devices are officially supported by AMD.

### Install SYCL implementations

First you'll need to install your chosen SYCL implementation and any
dependencies they require.

#### Installing ComputeCpp

To set up ComputeCpp download the [ComputeCpp CE package][computecpp-download]
and follow the [getting started instructions][computecpp-getting-started].

#### Installing DPC++

To set up DPC++ follow the
[getting started instructions][dpcpp-getting-started].

If you are using the Intel DevCloud then the latest version of DPC++ will
already be installed and available in the path.

#### Installing hipSYCL

To set up hipSYCL download the [repository packages][hip-sycl-download] and
install them.

### Pre-requisites

Before building the exercises you'll need:

* One of the platforms in the support matrix above, depending on which SYCL
implementation you are wishing to build for.
* A C++17 or above tool-chain.
* An appropriate build system for the platform you are targeting (CMake, Ninja,
Make, Visual Studio).

### Configuring using CMake (ComputeCpp CE and hipSYCL only)

Clone this repository, there are some additional dependencies configured as git
sub-modules so make sure to clone those as well. Then simply invoke CMake as
follows:

```
mkdir build

cd build

cmake ../ -G<cmake_generator> -A<cmake_arch> -D<sycl_implementation>=ON
```

For `<cmake_generator>` / `<cmake_arch>` we recommend:

* Visual Studio 16 2019 / x64 (Windows)
* Ninja / NA (Windows or Linux)
* Make / NA (Linux)

For `sycl_implementation` this can be one of:

* `SYCL_ACADEMY_USE_COMPUTECPP`
* `SYCL_ACADEMY_USE_HIPSYCL`

You can also specify the additional optional options:

-DSYCL_ACADEMY_INSTALL_ROOT=<path_to_sycl_impl_install_root>

For `<path_to_sycl_impl_install_root>` we recommend you specify the path to the
root directory of your SYCL implementation installation, though this may not
always be required.

-DSYCL_ACADEMY_ENABLE_SOLUTIONS=ON

This will enable building the solutions for each exercise as well as the source
files. This is disabled by default.

### Compiling directly (DPC++ only)

If you are using DPC++ there is no CMake integration, but it is very simple to
use the DPC++ compiler directly.

First you have to ensure that your environment is configured to use DPC++ (note
if you are using the Intel DevCloud then you don't need to do this step). Simply
call the `setvars.sh` which when is available in `/opt/intel/inteloneapi` when
installed as root or sudo and `~/intel/inteloneapi/` otherwise.

`source /opt/intel/inteloneapi/setvars.sh`

or

`source ~/intel/inteloneapi/setvars.sh`

Once that's done you can invoke the DPC++ compiler as follows:

`dpcpp -o a.out source.cpp`

## Online Interactive Tutorial

Hosted by tech.io, this [SYCL Introduction](https://tech.io/playgrounds/48226/introduction-to-sycl/introduction-to-sycl-2) tutorial introduces the concepts of SYCL. The website also provides the ability to compile and execute SYCL code from your web browser.

## Setting up Computers for SYCL

#### Machine Setup Instructions

ComputeCpp, a SYCL v1.2.1 conformant implementation by Codeplay Software provides setup instructions on [developer.codeplay.com](https://developer.codeplay.com). There is more detailed information about what hardware is supported by ComputeCpp on the [Platform Support](https://developer.codeplay.com/products/computecpp/ce/guides/platform-support) page.

Other SYCL implementations can be found on the SYCL community website [sycl.tech](https://sycl.tech).

#### Setting up a Docker Container for Lab Machines

In order to more easily deploy a SYCL implementation onto a bank of machines in a university lab for example, a Docker container can be used to deploy on these machines. This ensures all the dependencies that are needed are installed on each machine.

An example of how to set up a Docker container:

For Intel CPU or GPU
* Download the OpenCL Drivers for Intel from the [Intel website](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/opencl-drivers)
* Download the latest ComputeCpp release package from [developer.codeplay.com](https://developer.codeplay.com)

Now create a DockerFile that uses these packages, an example of how this might be done is below. Please note this file is not tested or maintained regularly but shows the elements that need to be installed.
