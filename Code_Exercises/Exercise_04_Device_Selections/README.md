## Exercise 5: Device Selection

---

In this exercise you will learn how to create a device selector that will choose
a device for you to enqueue work to.

We assume you have your environment set up to compile, since we did that in Exercise 01.
Ask for help if you have not completed Exercise 01 - we are here to help!

This exercise uses the solution from Exercise 03 as it's basis, which was based on prior exercises.
It should look familiar.
If you have extra time, we hope you'll explore making more additions or changes.
