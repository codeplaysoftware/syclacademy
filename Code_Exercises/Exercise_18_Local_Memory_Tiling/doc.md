## Exercise 18: Local Memory Tiling
---

In this exercise you will learn how to cache global memory into local memory in
tiles according to work-groups in order to compare the performance difference. 

If using ComputeCPP you need to ```#define STBI_NO_SIMD``` before the include ```#include <image_conv.h>```.


---

### 1.) Use local memory

Allocate local memory for the kernel function by creating a local `accessor`,
you can do this by creating an `accessor` with the `access::target::local`
access target template parameter.

The local `accessor` is create by specifying a `range` which is the number of
elements to allocate.

Note that local memory is allocated per work-group and each work-group can only
access it's own local memory.

### 2.) Cache global memory access in local memory

Cache the global memory required for each work-group in local memory by reading
from global `accessor` and then writing to the local `accessor`.

Remember to use the local id to know where in local memory to store the data,
this can be queried by calling the `nd_item` member function `get_local_id`.

Compare the performance with local memory and without local memory.
