## Exercise 11: Use of oneMKL library
---

In this exercise you will learn how to make use of APIs from oneMKL Interfaces library.
More specifically to perform a matrix multiplication using GEMM.

The source code provides template to perform GEMM using oneMKL's USM/buffer API:
Please refer to the API here: https://spec.oneapi.io/versions/latest/elements/oneMKL/source/domains/blas/gemm.html

## Exercise `OneMKL_usm_gemm/source.cpp`

The source code invloves matrix array initialization on host and generate reference results on the host.
`source_*.cpp` has templates with TODOs to complete the exercise

## Build and execution hints

To run the example: ./OneMKL_usm_gemm_solution (or) ./OneMKL_usm_gemm_source
To verify with CUBLAS debug info, `export CUBLAS_LOGINFO_DB=1` and `export CUBLAS_LOGDEST_DBG=stdout`
