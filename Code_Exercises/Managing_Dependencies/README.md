## Exercise 10: Managing Dependencies
---

In this exercise you will learn how to create a data dependency data flow graph
in both the buffer/accessor and USM models.

---

### 1.) Define a data flow graph with the buffer/accessor model

Using everything you have learned in previous exercises create an application
using the buffer/accessor model which has four kernel functions. These kernel
functions can do any computation you like, but they should follow the following
dependencies.

          (kernel A)
         /          \
    (kernel B)  (kernel C)
         \          /
          (kernel D)

The important thing here is that kernels B and C must depend on kernel A, kernel
D must depend on kernels B and C and kernels B and C can be executed in any
order and even concurrently if the device permits. Note that in the
buffer/accessor these dependencies are created implicitly using the creation of
`accessor`s.

Feel free to use any method of synchronization and copy back you like, but
remember to handle errors.

### 2.) Define a data flow graph with the USM model

Now do the same again but using the USM model. Note that in the USM model
dependencies are defined explicitly by chaining commands via `event`s.

Again feel free to use any method of synchronization and copy back you like,
but remember to handle errors.
