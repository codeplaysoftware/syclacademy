If you haven't done so already, use CMake to configure then build the exercises:
```sh
# <target specification> is a list of backends and devices to target, for example
# "omp;generic" compiles for CPUs with the OpenMP backend and GPUs using the generic single-pass compiler.
# The simplest target specification is "omp" which compiles for CPUs using the OpenMP backend.
cmake -DSYCL_ACADEMY_USE_ADAPTIVECPP=ON -DSYCL_ACADEMY_ENABLE_SOLUTIONS=OFF
-DSYCL_ACADEMY_INSTALL_ROOT=/insert/path/to/adaptivecpp -DACPP_TARGETS="<target specification>" ..
```

To compile,from the syclacademy directory:
```sh
cd build/Code_Exercises/<Exercise directory>
make <exercise name>_source
```
 
alternatively, without CMake:
```sh
cd Code_Exercises/<Exercise directory>
/path/to/adaptivecpp/bin/acpp -o sycl-<exercise name>_source -I../External/Catch2/single_include --acpp-targets="<target specification>" source.cpp
./sycl-<exercise name>_source
```
