This code is used as a walkthrough during ISC24 to help you understand a more 
complex way to write SYCL code using Functors and other techniques like 
nd-range.

This is based on the exercises in the main branch of the SYCL Academy project 
so you can re-visit this after ISC to learn more about SYCL development.
